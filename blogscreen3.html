                <h1>Introduction:</h1>
                Since the invention of AI and Machine Learning in the 1900s, the digital world has transformed dramatically. Machine Learning is a field of study that comes under Artificial Intelligence. It studies and develops statistical algorithms and generates data and performs tasks without instructions. It uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) which works just like our brains. As neurons connect with each other and create synapses in human brains, different nodes of information connect, process, and analyze complex data patterns. ANN plays a highly productive role in various domains such as image recognition, predictive analysis and NLP. This technology has revolutionised Machine Learning to the next level and established the foundation for advanced AI applications.

                <h1>Machine Learning and Web Development in 2024: </h1>
                Web developers are always looking for ways to understand user needs and demands to enhance their experience. Machine Learning has shown its miracles in various fields including web development. By incorporating AI and Machine Learning technology into your website, you can easily automate complex processes and get desired results by increasing user engagement and experience.
                 <br>

             <h1>  Benefits of Machine Learning in Web Development </h1>

             Machines analyse complex data faster than humans. Let's see how machine learning can benefit you as a web developer.
             No wonder these days companies are becoming smarter at understanding the needs and wishes of their customers. It's all due to AI and Machine Learning. Organisations can analyse user preferences, experiences and browsing history to create more personalised content for them. As we can see on e-commerce websites, they use recommendation systems to analyse a large amount of data to analyse the perspectives and preferences of their target audience. According to the previous data history of a specific user, they can suggest certain products and services. It results in more conversions and a higher turnover rate. In addition, ML can also be used for automated image/voice recognition, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and completion of repetitive tasks. As a result, manual work can be avoided and time can be saved for other purposes.
             Reduced labour work, more user engagement, an enhanced user experience with higher turnover rates are just a few examples of benefits. In a nutshell, AI and ML are life savers for web developers in multiple ways.
